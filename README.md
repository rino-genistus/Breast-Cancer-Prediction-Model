# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model
This project using different machine learning models to classify breast tumors as **benign or malignant** based off different diagnostic features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity statistics. 

The methods that were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression (with feature scaling)
- Random Forest (with and without hyperparameter tuning)
- Gradient Boosting
